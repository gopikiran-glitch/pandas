# pandas-day-2-learning

Welcome to **pandas-day-2-learning** 




On Day 2 we dive deeper into pandas and focus on:

- Using DataFrame methods and manipulations  
- Handling missing or duplicate data  
- Performing grouping, aggregation and summarisation  
- Working with time‐series or date/time data (if included)  
- Practical exercises / example problems (such as “customers who never ordered”, “big countries”, etc)  
- Building confidence for using pandas in analysis workflows
